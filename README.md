# fake-bundler
Just a fake bundler

## Problem
This repo contains some code that calls a `bundle(entry, srcPath)`.

It also contains a little "parser" that would parse out an "import" and "content" in .txt files.

Using these, implement the `bundle` function that can traverse a graph of these text files.

## Test
Use the following to test out your results:

`node .`

## Feel stuck?

Just look at the `solutions` branch.
